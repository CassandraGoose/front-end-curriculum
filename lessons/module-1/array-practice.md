## Mild Practice

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>Calculate Daily Pay</h3>
  <p>Trisha gets paid $22 each time she walks a dog. The array below holds 7 numbers, the number of dog walks she took each day last week. Iterate over the array, and print out "Trisha earned $____ today!" for each day.</p>
  <code class="try-it-code">var dogWalks = [4, 5, 2, 2, 6, 1, 3]</code>
  <p></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>YELLING</h3>
  <p>Iterate over an array of strings. For each string, print out the YELLING version of it. Look into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase">how to convert a string to uppercase</a>!</p>
</div>

## Medium Practice

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>Calculate Total Pay</h3>
  <p>Trisha gets paid $22 each time she walks a dog. The array below holds 7 numbers, the number of dog walks she took each day last week. Write a function that takes one argument, an Array of Numbers, and that returns her total pay.</p>
  <code class="try-it-code">var dogWalks = [4, 5, 2, 2, 6, 1, 3]</code>
  <p></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>Best Client</h3>
  <p>Kayla gets paid various amounts by each client for a dog walk. The array below holds 7 numbers, the hourly amounts. Write a function that takes one argument, an Array of Numbers, and that returns her highest paying dog-walking gig.</p>
  <p>If this were the array representing Kayla's different hourly rates: <code class="try-it-code">var hourlyPay = [22, 17, 29, 16, 18]</code>, this function should return the Number 29.</p>
</div>

## Spicy Practice

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>Sum of Two</h3>
  <p>Write a function that takes one argument, an Array of Numbers. It should return the sum of the two lowest positive numbers in that array (an array with a minimum of 4 numbers will be passed in). No empty arrays will be passed in. For example, when an array is passed in like <code class="try-it-code">[19, 5, 42, 2, 77]</code>, the output should be <code class="try-it-code">7</code> because <code class="try-it-code">5 + 2 = 7</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
  <h3>Find the Odd (or Even) One Out</h3>
  <p>Write a function that takes in one argument - an array of numbers. The array must have at least 3 elements. All numbers except for one of them will be either even or odd. You job is to return that <strong>one</strong> number that is the exception. Below are some example inputs and outputs. Make sure your function works on them all.</p>
  <p>Input: <code class="try-it-code">[1, 3, 5, 6]</code>, Output: <code class="try-it-code">6</code></p>
  <p>Input: <code class="try-it-code">[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50]</code>, Output: <code class="try-it-code">15</code></p>
  <p>Input: <code class="try-it-code">[19, 5, 42, 1, 77]</code>, Output: <code class="try-it-code">42</code></p>
</div>
