## Overview

It's a dog party!  The reality is, as a frontend developer, you're going to be building out a lot of the UI on websites and apps.  This can be a lot of fun, and you definitely want to get good at it!  One of the beginning pieces is using semantic html and writing clean CSS.  Similar to what you might do in a job, you've got a comp and need to build it out.

### Setup Info

- Clone down [the repo linked here](https://github.com/turingschool/dog-party-challenge).
- Note that some boilerplate code was provided to get you up and running a little quicker
- You will not need to use git or push any changes up to submit, so don't worry about making a repo, removing the remote repo, etc. Just get to work

### Your Challenge

- With your partner, work to recreate the comp provided below
- You only have a little over an hour, so its likely you won't have time to make it pixel perfect - that's ok! Start with the general layout, then work your way into details.
