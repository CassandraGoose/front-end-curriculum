## Learning Goals

* Continue to learn how to access and use the Chrome Developer Tools
* Continue to develop a basic understanding for JavaScript syntax
* Understand how to query and update a page after its been loaded

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to customize a user's experience on a small site based on some input they provide. Below is a giphy of this type of experience in action:

Before we can implement functionality like this though, we're going to build a strong foundation and understanding of the tools that help us do that.

## Vocabulary

- `HTML Element` A building block that makes up the structure of a web page.
- `CSS Selector` A way to identify a set elements, typically using a tag, class or id.
- `Interface` a shared boundary across which two separate components exchange information.
- `DOM` Document Object Model, the JS interface used to interact with HTML
- `Event` Any event which takes place in the DOM, these can be generated by users or the browser.
- `Event Handler` A function that will run when a specific event occurs
- `Method` A type of function for a specific object

## Greeting App Activity to illustrate need for DOM

## Document Object Model

The Document Object Model, DOM, is an interface for HTML. It is what allows us to use JavaScript to manipulate the elements or content of elements on a page. Think back to our Greeting App example - somehow, JavaScript has to know what was typed into that input field, know that the button was clicked, and be able to add content below the button. If we didn't have the DOM, this wouldn't be possible.

Once the browser runs our HTML, it creates the DOM. The DOM represents what is in the HTML, but it is formatted in a way that we can interact with those elements via JavaScript. It is _not_ the exact same thing as your HTML document.

Here's a small HTML file:

Here's the DOM tree that would be created:

This is an abstract concept and can be hard to wrap your mind around - we'll come back to it. For now, you need to know two things:
1. The DOM is essential to building functionality on a page
2. We can use the `document` variable in our JavaScript file to interact with the DOM. From there, we can travel through the DOM and ask for specific elements, or instruct the program to change elements.

### Check It Out

In your browser dev tools, type in `document`. Click that small arrow to the left of the output.  
- What do you see?
- Where else can you find that content?
</section>

At any time, you can call `document` to access the DOM. This is very close to the same thing as viewing the document in the Elements panel of the Dev Tools. We won't get into the details of those small differences; if you are interested, start by reading [this blog post](https://bitsofco.de/what-exactly-is-the-dom/).

## Accessing a Specific Element

Our `document` object comes built-in with a lot of methods we can use. Today, we will learn about `.querySelector()`. This method allows us to request a specific element from the DOM tree, by its selector. It uses the same syntax for selectors as CSS does. Here's an example:

```javascript
var title = document.querySelector('h1');

title;

//=> <h1>Intro to DOM Manipulation</h1>
```

<section class="call-to-action">
### Explore

Open the Dev Tools while you are looking at this lesson. In the console, paste this in:

`var box = document.querySelector('.call-to-action');`

Then, call the `box` variable (by typing in `box`, then hitting `return`).

**Discuss with your partner:**
- What is returned?
- Where is that element in the browser?
- There are several sections with that class name on this page - why do you think that only _one_ of them is stored in the `box` variable?
</section>

## Updating Content of an Element

So far, we haven't made much headway in terms of _doing_ anything - but we've built some important foundations. It is now time to learn how to update the content of an element we've accessed.

We'll continue using our `title` variable for this example.

```javascript
var title = document.querySelector('h1');
```

Since our box variable stores a DOM element, we now have access to another set of properties methods that are built for DOM elements. We won't learn about all of them today. We'll focus on `innerText`, and time permitting `innerHTML`.

### `innerText`

This is a property which holds the text that lives inside of a given element. Right now, the content inside of the `h1` on this page is `Intro to DOM Manipulation` so that is what the `innerText` is. We can use the assignment operator to change it.

<img class="small" src="./assets/images/dom-manipulation-1/inner-text.png">

After running the code in the console that is pictured above, the text of the `h1` changed from `Intro to DOM Manipulation` to `Hello, World!`. Now, this may feel a bit disconnected because we know that we usually write our JavaScript in a file in atom, not in the Dev Tools. **If we wrote this in the JavaScript file associated with the page, we'd have the exact same result.** To reinforce this, you're going to have some time to practice applying this concept.

### Try It

Fork [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/turing-school/pen/bGGmOrR) and complete the steps listed below.

- Declare a variable `heading` and assign it to the value of the `h1` element
- Declare a variable `sub-heading` and assign it to the value of the `h3` element
- Declare a variable `name` and assign it to the value of the element with a class of `name`
- Change the `innerText` of the `h1` to "I love coding"
- Change the `innerText` of the `h3` to "Mod 1"
- Change the `innerText` of the `.name` to your name!
</section>

### `innerHTML`

This property essentially works the same, but has the capacity to do something a little more complex for us.

It can not only insert plain text, but it can insert HTML elements. For the example below, we will go back to using the "call to action" box.

```javascript
var box = document.querySelector('.call-to-action');

box.innerHTML = `
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>a bunch of text here</p>
`;
```

Try running this code in the browser and see what happens to the first "call to action" box that appears on the page!

## Changing Styles Programmatically

It isn't rare to see an application change the color of something after a user interacts with it.

We see things like...
- Toggling light and dark mode
- A grey check mark turn into a green one
- A box or button changing colors once we've already clicked it, or visited that link
... on almost a daily basis!

We talked earlier about how powerful the DOM is because it allows us to interact with HTML elements via JavaScript. This also gives us the power to **modify the styles applied to said elements** via JavaScript.

We will briefly discuss two ways to do this:
1. Directly manipulate the style of the element through inline styles
2. **Add or remove classes from the element** (the preferred way).

### Directly Manipulate the Style of the Element

We can call the `.style` property on an element, then any CSS property:

```javascript
var box = document.querySelector('.call-to-action');

box.style.borderColor = "red";
```

This will result in:

<img class="medium" src="./assets/images/dom-manipulation-1/inline-style.png">

The reason this is not preferred is we usually want to make more than one tiny change; and each change requires one line of code. This can make for long functions that are difficult to read. Adding or removing classes (examples below) is strongly preferred.

<section class="note">
### Then Why Bring It Up?

Often times, your instructors at Turing will share with you an overview of something, including the multiple ways something can be done, but tell you that one is preferred. Why do we bother to bring up the less-than-ideal approaches?

As a developer, a huge part of your job is researching and learning on your own. That will also be a huge part of being a student at Turing. You'll sift through documentation, blog posts, and Stack Overflow posts. It's important to be familiar with the multiple ways of doing things, different syntax, best practices, etc. so you can more easily sift through those resources and determine what is good and helpful.
</section>

### Add or Remove Classes from the Element

Since it's common to need to change multiple CSS declarations, we can instead add or remove a class from the list of classes a given element has on it.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Check It Out

Fork [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/turing-school/pen/MWWPLYx) and follow the directions below:
- Read through the code that is currently written, and observe the result in the mini-browser
- Un-comment line 3. What changed about the button? What remained the same?
- Un-comment line 4. What changed about the button? What remained the same?
</section>

Typically, if you are going to add/remove a class via JavaScript, that class should be declared **below** the class that originally styled the given element. This is because of the cascading nature of CSS; any time rules conflict, the rule declared lower on the sheet will take precedence.

Read up on [this documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) to learn how to **remove** a class from an elements classList! Hint: `toggle` may soon be a friend of yours, as well!
