## Learning Goals

* Describe what an object literal is
* Define properties and methods in an object literal
* Access values and methods from an object using dot and bracket notation

## Vocabulary

- `Object` A bundle of behavior (methods) and state (properties)
- `Key` The name used to reference a value on an object
- `Value` The data referenced by a key
- `Property` Another word for the 'key' portion of a key-value pair on an object
- `Method` A function on an object
- `Dot Notation` Notation to access a value on an object, explicitly specifies the key

## Warm Up
Fill in the blanks on the worksheet at your table, nice a BIG, CLEAR handwriting!

We are pretending that we are making an order at a coffee shop.

## Objects

Objects are a type of collection, or complex data type in JavaScript. An array is another type of collection. We can think of objects as a representation of real world things in computer programming.

They are meant to bundle together two things:

1. State (data)
2. Behavior (functionality)

## When to use Objects

We just got the hang of arrays and are feeling pretty great about them - when/why do we also need objects?

- When we don‚Äôt care about the order of items (array)
- When we need an associative relationship (title for some info)

If I wanted to make a list of the handles of all my favorite creators on TikTok, I should use an array. They are all strings, they are all holding the same type of information. I don‚Äôt care about the number of followers they have, if they are verified, or anything else.

If I wanted to make a list of the handles of all my favorite creators on TikTok and their number of followers, I should use an object. There is an associative relationship between each creator and their follower count.

_Later in the lesson, we will take a look at what an object that holds all that data might look like!_

### Turn + Talk: Array or Object?
For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Why?

- List of all of the students in class
- List of states and their capitals
- List of things to pack for vacation
- Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
- List of scholar names and the school they attend
- Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
- All my favorite restaurants

## Anatomy of Objects

There are several ways to create an object, and the easiest and most popular is _literal notation_. The only thing you need in JavaScript to declare an object is curly braces ```{}```. Although, it makes things a bit easier if you at least assign it to a variable, like so: ```var emptyObject = {};```

Objects are a collection of _key-value pairs_ surrounded by _curly braces_. A _key_ is like a _name_ that holds a value. You're actually used to working with key-value pairs already, because a key-value pair in an object is similar to a variable - the variable name serves as a label for the data we really care about referencing.

In the context of objects, that variable is called a _property_ of the object. Each property in an object **must be unique**. You cannot have two properties with the same name.

Let's look at an example:

```javascript
var objectName = {
  property1: "value1",
  property2: "value2",
};
```

Which looks like this when we implement it in code:

```javascript
var school = {
  name: "International School of Denver",
  capacity: 250,
  languageImmersion: true,
  currentStudents: 75,
};
```
The `school` object has four properties:

- `name: "International School of Denver"`
- `capacity: 250`
- `languageImmersion: true`
- `currentStudents: 75`

### Solo Practice: Turn some facts into an Object

Create a new repl.

Declare a new variable called <code>order</code> that stores an object literal. It should have all the properties that were printed on the handout you got this morning, paired with the values you handwrote in.
</section>

### Access Properties

There are two ways to access the properties or methods of an object, today we will focus on **Dot Notation:**

```js
var schoolName = school.name;
var schoolCapacity = school.capacity;
```

<section class="call-to-action">
### Solo Practice: Accessing Data about YOU

Return to the repl you created with your object.

Practice using dot notation to access each value on your order object.
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Partner Practice: Accessing Properties

Choose a driver and a navigator. The driver should start by forking [this repl.it](https://repl.it/@ameseee/Dot-Notation-Practice)

Together, complete each exercise listed in the comments below the two object literals. Write the code with a given direction directly below it, and do not delete code as you go.
</section>

<!-- There is also bracket notation:

```js
var schoolName = school["name"];
var schoolCapacity = school["capacity"];
```

Bracket notation is usually used when the name of the property is stored in a variable or parameter.  This can make it dynamic, since the value in a variable can _vary_.

```js
function getSchoolValue(prop) {
  return school[prop];
}

getSchoolValue("name");
```

Another example can be seen [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5#properties).

Default to using Dot Notation unless you need to access properties with a variable/parameter.   -->

### Adding a Property

What if we wanted to add another property to an object after we already created it? By accessing the object and using dot notation, we can create another unique property and assign it whatever value we want. This works almost exactly like a variable. Take a look at an example below:

```js
school.address = "7701 E 1st Pl, Denver, CO 80230";
console.log(school);

// console output
// => {
//   name: "International School of Denver",
//   capacity: 250,
//   languageImmersion: true,
//   currentStudents: 75,
//   sendWelcomeMessage: function() {
//      return "Welcome to International School of Denver!"
//   },
//   address: "7701 E 1st Pl, Denver, CO 80230"
// }
```
<section class="call-to-action">

### Solo Practice: Reassigning & Adding
- Go back to the repl about your order, and add a property of "location" to your object. Assign it to a string of any coffee shop location you frequent.
- Now try re-assigning the **drinkOrder** property to a different string.
- ü§ûRemember to call the object or the property on the last line of the file (or in the console), and run the repl to verify the outcome!

## Objects IRL

Similar to arrays, it‚Äôs very likely that every application you‚Äôve used utilized objects in the code that built it.

In the intro to this lesson, we talked about how TikTok might use an object to group together information about a specific creator.

Let's dig into this code snippet and try to understand what it is doing/what it represents:

```js
var trending = [
  {
    name: "Evan The Card Guy",
    handle: "@thecardguy",
    followers: 7000000,
    tagline: "100k on YouTube? üëÜ insta: evanthecardguy üìß evanthecardguy@gmail.com"
  },
  {
    name: "Spencer X",
    handle: "@Spencerx",
    followers: 13800000,
    tagline: "üó£ Mouth Music Man üé∂ Follow me on IG and YouTube :) üëáüèºüëÜüèº"
  },
  {
    name: "Avani",
    handle: "@avani",
    followers: 7100000,
    tagline: "if you don‚Äôt love me i love you MERCHANDISE IS OUT!! - FANJOY.CO/AVANI"
  },
  {
    name: "Loren Grey",
    handle: "@lorengrey",
    followers: 36700000,
    tagline: "No bio yet."
  },

];
```

Or, for a more visual representation:

<img src="https://ameseee.github.io/kwk-curriculum-site/web-app/lessons/js-objects/assets/tiktok-array-obj.png" alt="screen shot of TikTok with array and object syntax laid over it">

There are still 4 elements in this array, but each element is now an object so there are many more lines of code! We may or may not need an array that has so many moving pieces; this piece of the lesson was just intended to help you make a real-life connection.

## Methods on Objects

When we assign a function as the value to one of our keys (remember that a function is a tool we use to return a value!), we call that function a _method_.

Let's look at an example:

```javascript
var objectName = {
  property1: "value1",
  property2: "value2",
  method1: function() {
    return "I'm a method, because I am a function!";
  },
};
```

This looks like a lot more code, and potentially a bit more daunting, but when we read through it slowly, we can recognize:
- There is a key name, followed by a colon
- ONE value as a property

The difference is that our property is now a function definition.

Which looks like this when we implement it in code:

```javascript
var school = {
  name: "International School of Denver",
  capacity: 250,
  languageImmersion: true,
  currentStudents: 75,
  sendWelcomeMessage: function() {
    return "Welcome to International School of Denver!"
  },
};
```

The `school` object has one method:

```js
sendWelcomeMessage: function() {
  return "Welcome to International School of Denver!"
},
```

To call the `sendWelcomeMessage` method that belongs to the `school` object, we have to take one step at a time:
1. Tell the program we are interested in something regarding the `school` object
2. Tell the program we are specifically interested in the `sendWelcomeMessage` method
3. Call the `sendWelcomeMessage` method using `()`

In action, it looks like this:

```js
school.sendWelcomeMessage();
```

## Turn and Talk

- When reading the code snippet above, how would you say, out loud, in English, what we are doing?
- When we used dot notation at the start of the lesson, we didn't follow a property name with `()`. Why do you think we are using that here? What does it remind you of? Further, what do you think would happen if we called `school.sendWelcomeMessage`?
</section>

Let's add a method to our order object.

<section class="checks-for-understanding">
### Stop and Reflect
**First:** Independently, take a few minutes to write about each prompt below:
- To start, go ahead and make an object or two.
- How do you create an object using literal notation?
- What is an object and what is it made up of?
- When we assign a function as the value of a key inside an object, what do we call it?

**Then:** Turn to your neighbor and explain the above object-related questions to each other. Practice makes perfect, so make sure you both get to explain!
