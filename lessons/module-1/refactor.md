## Learning Goals

* Identify areas of code that need to be refactored
* Utilize arguments and parameters to DRY up code

## Vocabulary

- `DRY` Don't Repeat Yourself!
- `refactor` Rewriting working code for readability, maintainability, or performance without changing it's behavior

### Warm Up

Talk with your partner: If someone says, "this needs to be refactored", what might they see that makes them say that?

Then, scroll through [this `main.js` for a Number Guesser project](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/num-guess-refactor/blob/master/main.js) (do NOT clone it down right now), and take note of 2-3 opportunities for refactoring.

## Modeling a Refactor

As you watch a real person refactor in real time, take note of the questions they ask themselves and the things they consider.

### It's Not A Race

Refactoring is more of an art. It should not be rushed.

You should be following the red-green-refactor flow, just as you do with TDD. Refactoring is the step we take after things work. The code is _ok_, but the goal of this process is to make it _great_. To do this well, great developers are methodical and thorough.

### Your Turn

With the repo you select based on the level of heat you want, take these steps:
- Make sure you are familiar with the current functionality (i.e., run the app in the browser!)
- There are many refactoring opportunities here. With your partner, decide on **one** area to focus your energy.
- Rubber duck it - what do you know? Which parts seem almost `impossible` right now? Takes notes in notebook or with comments to start chipping away at the challenge.
- Once you feel like you are done, ensure that the app is behaving as it originally was in the browser. Make sure to clean up any old comments, old code, whitespace, etc.

**Mild:** Clone down [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/num-guess-refactor).
**Medium:** Use your Number Guesser repo
**Spicy:** Ask another group for the link to the repo
