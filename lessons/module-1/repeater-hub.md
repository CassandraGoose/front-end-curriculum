---

Welcome!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here!
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Create a copy of [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaylaewood/0fc2aa9c40d6151c67a81c1483667e90).

## Gear Ups and Professional Development
Weeks 1 and 5 of Gear Up lessons are optional. All PD sessions are optional. You will have a new set of prompts for your PD Journal. You can find those [here](********).

## Repeater Fam Time
In lieu of PD, there is `Repeater Fam`  time on the calendar. This is time for repeaters to use as they wish. You can spend that time on a zoom call reflecting on your week. You can spend it working together on mythical creatures. You can use it to play games and get to know each other better. It's your time, do what you want with it! Instructors will not join any of these calls.

## Optional Instructional Lessons:
The following lessons are from the first two weeks of mod 1. We want you to feel empowered to skip some classes if you feel like there is a better way to spend your time. **You can choose to skip up to 3 of the classes listed below.** If you are planning to skip an instructional lesson, please DM all instructors prior to the start of class to let us know. If you do not tell us ahead of time, you will be marked absent.
