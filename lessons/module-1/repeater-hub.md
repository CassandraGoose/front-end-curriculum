title: Mod 1 Repeater Hub

Welcome! Please read this entire page completely. Reach out to your instructors if you have any questions!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here so it's important to check this channel daily.
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=16&v=U4IU-y9-J8Q&feature=youtu.be) on creating SMART Goals. Then, add your name to [this Goals Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CnFCMSFyadbPoMP_ii0NnxQRoZnXKDT2JP-n56yZq8/edit?usp=sharing) and fill out your goal for Intermission. We will check in on these goals on the Monday of Week 1.

## Gear Ups and Professional Development
Weeks 1 and 5 of Gear Up lessons are optional. All PD sessions (including the Giving & Receiving Feedback lesson) are optional. You will have a new set of prompts for your PD Journal. You can find the new prompts and more information [here](https://careerdev.turing.io/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan).

## Repeater Fam Time
In lieu of PD, there is **Repeater Fam** time on the calendar. During this time, you will join a zoom call to connect with each other, reflect on the past week, and create goals for the current week. Instructors will not join any of these calls. During the calls, we ask that you fill out [this Goals Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CnFCMSFyadbPoMP_ii0NnxQRoZnXKDT2JP-n56yZq8/edit?usp=sharing) for the appropriate week.

## Alternative Learning Opportunities
We want you to feel empowered to skip some classes if you feel like there is a better way to spend your time. **You can choose to miss up to 3 classes from the first two weeks of the inning.**   

If you are planning to skip an instructional lesson, please DM all instructors prior to the start of class to let us know. If you do not tell us ahead of time, you will be marked absent. The following lessons are from the first two weeks of mod 1:
* JS: Data Types
* JS: Object Literals
* JS: Bracket & Dot Notation
* JS: Functions
* JS: For Loops
* JS: Intro to Unit Testing
* JS: Intro to the DOM
* JS: Event Listeners
* JS: Classes
* JS: Unit Testing Classes
* Dev Skills: Git Workflow
* HTML Fundamentals
* CSS Fundamentals

For more on this, check out the **FAQs** below!

## FAQs
**Q:** *How can I know if I should skip a class or not?*  
**A:** If you decide to skip a lesson, you should always read through the lesson on your own. If you can complete all of the activities in the lesson without help, you should feel confident skipping that lesson. We recommend doing this no later than the day before the lesson is scheduled. That way, if you realize that you need to attend the class, it's not too late!  

**Q:** *If I skip a class, how should I spend that time?*  
**A:** You should be spending this time productively. It's not to your benefit to use this time as "off" time. You can use this time to pre-teach an upcoming lesson, review or update your notes, or work on anything in the [Extra Practice page](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/extra-practice.html).  

**Q:** *Should I delete my mythical creatures repo and start over?*
**A:** Yes! You should delete your old javascript-foundations repo and then clone down a new one and start over. It's important that you approach these problems with a clean slate. Plus, we may have updated the repo since last inning.  

**Q:** *Should I complete mythical creatures over and over?*
**A:** No! You should only complete each mythical creature **once** this inning. After you complete all of the creatures, start working through the other test suites in that repo. We find that when students complete the same test suite more than 2 times, memorization and pattern matching kick in (which is not what we want!). These test suites should be improving your problem solving skills. If you feel yourself being able to write code without reading the full test, it's probably time for a new test suite.  

**Q:** *Should I reference my old projects when working on projects this inning?*
**A:** This is not a good idea. Remember, the projects are about learning, not completion. We'd rather you productively struggle through the logic on a project than just look back at how you did it last time and copy the answer. Also, this approach isn't fair to your project partner(s) who is seeing this stuff for the first time. We know it's tempting, but remember **it's about process over product**.  

**Q:** *Should I get a head start on projects?*
**A:** You should not be working on projects before they are officially kicked off. There is plenty for you to work on if you finish a project early (hint: the **Extra Practice** section!). Projects are meant to be completed in the time allotted. Also, instructors make changes to project specs leading up to the kickoff. Finally, one goal of group/paired projects is collaborative learning and communication and that is sacrificed when students work ahead on these projects.
