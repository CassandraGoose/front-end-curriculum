# Mod 1 Repeater Hub
Welcome!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here!
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Create a copy of [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaylaewood/0fc2aa9c40d6151c67a81c1483667e90).

## Gear Ups and Professional Development
Weeks 1 and 5 of Gear Up lessons are optional. All PD sessions are optional. You will have a new set of prompts for your PD Journal. You can find those [here](********).

## Repeater Fam Time
In lieu of PD, there is `Repeater Fam` time on the calendar. This is time for repeaters to use as they wish. You can spend that time on a zoom call reflecting on your week. You can spend it working together on mythical creatures. You can use it to play games and get to know each other better. It's your time, do what you want with it!

additional ideas:
- group dynamics for projects
- clarity on how to choose if you should go to classes or not
- potentially: self-assessments for JS lessons
