title: Mod 1 Repeater Hub
---

Welcome! Please read this entire page completely. Reach out to your instructors if you have any questions!

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod1_repeater_fam**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here so it's important to check this channel daily.
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Goal Tracking
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=16&v=U4IU-y9-J8Q&feature=youtu.be) on creating SMART Goals. Then, add your name to [this Goals Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CnFCMSFyadbPoMP_ii0NnxQRoZnXKDT2JP-n56yZq8/edit?usp=sharing) and fill out your goal for Intermission. We will check in on these goals on the Monday of Week 1. Throughout the inning, add your goals for each upcoming week.

## Gear Ups and Professional Development
Weeks 1 and 5 of Gear Up lessons are optional. All PD sessions (including the Giving & Receiving Feedback lesson) are optional. You will have a new set of prompts for your PD Journal. You can find the new prompts and more information [here](https://careerdev.turing.io/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan).

## Repeater Fam Time
In lieu of PD, there is **Repeater Fam** time on the calendar. This is time for repeaters to use as they wish. You can spend that time on a zoom call reflecting on your week. You can spend it working together on mythical creatures. You can use it to play games and get to know each other better. It's your time, do what you want with it! Our only ask is that this time is spent in an intentional and collaborative way. Instructors will not join any of these calls.

## Optional Instructional Lessons
The following lessons are from the first two weeks of mod 1. We want you to feel empowered to skip some classes if you feel like there is a better way to spend your time. **You can choose to skip up to 3 of the classes listed below.** If you are planning to skip an instructional lesson, please DM all instructors prior to the start of class to let us know. If you do not tell us ahead of time, you will be marked absent.
* JS: Data Types
* JS: Object Literals
* JS: Bracket & Dot Notation
* JS: Functions
* JS: For Loops
* JS: Intro to Unit Testing
* JS: Intro to the DOM
* JS: Event Listeners
* JS: Classes
* JS: Unit Testing Classes
* Dev Skills: Git Workflow
* HTML Fundamentals
* CSS Fundamentals

## Extra Practice
Below are ways you can get in additional practice throughout the inning. None of these exercises are mandatory, but we find that the more unique problem sets students encounter and complete, the better their coding and problem-solving skills become.
* Daily Reps:
  * [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): Focus on psuedocoding level 8 katas
* Test Suites:  
  * [Skate Park](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/skatepark)
  * [Golf Course](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/golf-course)
  * [Oregon Trail](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/oregon-trail) *(needs to be audited)*
  * [Ski Lift](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ski-lift)
  * [Do you wanna build a snowman?](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/do-you-wanna-build-a-snowman)
  * ðŸŒ¶ **Create a new Mythical Creature.** Start by making a new test file in the `test` directory and write all of the tests. Then, add in a file in the `exercises` directory and write the code necessary to pass all of the tests you wrote. Send your new creature to your instructors - We may add it into the official test suite!
* CSS:
  * [Cookie Comp Recreation](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/cookie-comp)
  * [Countdown CSS Exploration](https://codepen.io/hannahhch/pen/mdEYqjX)
* DOM Maniputation & Event Listeners:
  * [Holiday Card Generator](https://codepen.io/hannahhch/pen/OJXGpxJ)
* Functions, Loops, & Objects:
  * [Gifts Repl](https://repl.it/@HannahHudson1/AdventDay1#index.js)
  * [Party Repl](https://repl.it/@HannahHudson1/Advent5#index.js)
  * [Ugly Sweater Generator Repl](https://repl.it/@HannahHudson1/Advent8)
* Refactoring:
  * [Snow Facts](https://codepen.io/hannahhch/pen/QWEPeKb)
  * **Refactor an old project.** Look back at one of your projects from last inning. Find the feedback that you received on that project from an instructor. Apply some of the recommended refactor opportunities mentioned in your feedback. Can you use parameters to create a reusable function and DRY up your JavaScript? Can you make your HTML more semantic? Can you organize your CSS in a better way?
* Projects:
  * [MadLibs](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/winter-mad-libs)
  * ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ [Number Guesser](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/0363dead1ccd862290d395241ec0f785891fc580/projects/archive/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.md) *(needs to be audited)*

## FAQs
* *Should I delete my mythical creatures repo and start over?* Yes! You should delete your old mythicals repo and then clone down a new one and start over. It's important that you approach these problems with a clean slate.
* *Should I complete mythical creatures over and over?* No! You should only complete each mythical creature **once** this inning. After you complete all of the creatures, start working through the **Test Suites** listed in the **Extra Practice** section. We find that when students complete the same test suite more than 2 times, memorization and pattern matching kick in (which is not what we want!). These test suites should be improving your problem solving skills. If you feel yourself being able to write code without reading the full test, it's probably time for a new test suite.
* *Should I reference my old projects when working on projects this inning?* This is not a good idea. Remember, the projects are about learning, not completion. We'd rather you productively struggle through the logic on a project than just look back at how you did it last time and copy the answer. Also, this approach isn't fair to your project partner(s) who is seeing this stuff for the first time. We know it's tempting, but remember **it's about process over product**.
* *Should I get a head start on projects?* You should not be working on projects before they are officially kicked off. There is plenty for you to work on if you finish a project early (hint: the **Extra Practice** section!). Projects are meant to be completed in the time allotted. Also, instructors make changes to project specs leading up to the kickoff. Finally, if this is a group or paired project, it is not fair for your partner(s) for you to have a head start.
* *How should I navigate partner and group work since I've seen a lot of this material before?*
* *How can I know if I should skip a class or not?* If you decide to skip a lesson, you should always read through the lesson on your own. We recommend doing this no later than the day before the lesson is scheduled. If you can complete all of the activities in the lesson without help, you should feel confident skipping that lesson.
* *If I skip a class, how should I spend that time?* You should be spending this time productively. It's not to your benefit to use this time as "off" time. You can use this time to preteach an upcoming lesson, review or update your notes, or work on anything in the **Extra Practice** section of this page.
