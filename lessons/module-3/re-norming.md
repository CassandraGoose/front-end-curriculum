## Introduction

Now that you're halfway through the program, it's time to revisit the norms you created in Mod 1! Just like the code we write, our norms can get better by iterating on them.

## Goals

* Review the existing norms
* Examine each norm
  - What does the norm mean?
  - Is it effective in promoting stronger community and building relationships?
  - Does it still work for us?
  - Can it be strengthened, made more specific, or improved in any way?
  - Do we still need it?
* Determine what's no longer helpful
* Determine what's missing

## Warm up

<section class="call-to-action">
### Reflect

In your journal, take a few minutes to think about the following questions:

1. What are the cohort norms you remember?
1. Are you happy with the cohort culture right now? What could change for the better?
1. Do you feel that you've been living up to the norms?
1. Are there areas you want to grow in? Is there an existing or new norm that could help?
</section>

## Review

For each norm, we'll discuss:  
* What is the goal of this norm? What does it mean?
* Has it been effective?
* Should we keep it?
* Should we update it (aka change the language, make it more specific, etc)?

## What's missing?

Instead of thinking from the perspective of "what norms do we need?", let's try thinking of the cohort culture in another way.

### Reflect

In your journal, take a few minutes to think about the following questions:

1. Who is the person you'd like to be in the classroom?
1. How does that person behave? What actions do they take? How do they help others?
1. Have you been behaving in that way?
1. What would help you be the person you want to be?
1. What is making it difficult?
</section>

## Remaking our world

Now that we've had the time to reflect, let's fill out a survey to capture our thoughts. The survey will be anonymous, so everyone can feel free to speak candidly and to ask for their needs/express their thoughts without fear or embarrassment.

Your instructors will drop a link to a survey in your Slack channel. Please take time now to fill it out.

## Locus of control

We each have a measure of control over our own actions and behaviors. While we cannot guarantee how our actions or inactions will impact someone else, we can approach our role within the classroom with thoughtfulness and intention.

Thinking back over the cohort norms, as you began to identify which norms were helpful and which were not, consider:

1. Have I made it a priority to consider the cohort norms?
1. Which norms have I not upheld?
1. Which norms do I want to focus on improving my engagement with?

Identify at least one norm you would like to keep more firmly in mind as you dive into Mod 3.

### Accountability

Flip to the back of your notebook and write down the norm you want to get better at holding to, so you can reference it easily.

Share that norm and goal with your accountabilibuddy now.
</section>

Throughout the module, your instructors will give you reminders to keep your goal in mind, and you will have time to check in with your accountabilibuddy as well.

### Next steps

During Friday's retro, you'll work together as a cohort to update, refine, and confirm your norms. It's a little like revisiting the DTR in the middle of the project to check - is this still working? What can we improve?

We do great things when we're working together! And we do our best work when we all feel safe enough to be heard and to listen. Let's set the tone for the rest of your time at Turing and the rest of your career as a developer right now, by recognizing your individual agency, and the strength there is within this community!
