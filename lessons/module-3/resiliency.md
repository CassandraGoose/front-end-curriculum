In this lesson, we're going to spend some time talking about a skill you've been learning the entire time at Turing, which is going to be helpful in this next chapter of your life!

### Learning Goals

- Understand the concept of resiliency
- Be able to recognize and interrupt thoughts that negate your abilities
- Practice skills that are a part of resiliency

## Vocab

- `Resiliency`: the tangible, physical expression of growth mindset; not allowing setbacks to push you back into fixed mindset
- `Growth mindset`: the understanding that growth and learning are progressive, instead of static states of being (fixed mindset)
- `Eustress`: the discomfort felt during the early stages of growth and learning; it motivates!

## Warm up

Think back to a time at Turing when you thought you weren't going to make it: through a project, through an assessment, through a class, through one more week. What had you feeling that way? What were the thoughts in your head saying that made you believe or wonder if you couldn't do it?

## What is resiliency?

Resiliency is the ability to come back from setbacks. It's another aspect of growth mindset! Because resiliency only works when you recognize your own skills & abilities, as well as being gracious around the fact that you are always learning.

### Note

Please note that resiliency is not "taking constant gutshots and turning the cheek forever" - it's important to recognize toxic, manipulative behavior and to set boundaries against it. Resiliency is not about getting tougher so we can continue to excuse abuse or racism or sexism or ableism or any other forms of bigotry. In fact resiliency is about trusting in oneself and one's community to fight these things together.

## The art of resiliency

In module 4, you learned about gracefully exiting a question during a technical interview that you didn't know the answer to. Remember - not knowing something is not a failure; it's a stepping stone! 

Today, we're going to do something similar, by learning to address the voices in our heads that tell us we can't do things.

### Scenarios

1. "Who are you kidding?! You can't possibly do this!"
1. "This is it. I'm doomed. I will forever wander the chilly world, looking for people to review my PRs."
1. "See? This is proof. You have been skating by on your charming personality and nice Zoom backgrounds, but NOW THEY KNOW YOU CAN'T HACK IT!"
1. "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy! Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me ... to me."

### Tools to rely on

Look back at your notes from the warm up. Vo√≠la! You've already got all the tools you need!

- All the people who helped you over the last year when you did this incredible, big thing
  - Thank you, family, friends, significant others, neighbors, pets!
- Your care-hortmates 
- Your instructors
- Ryan & Tracey
- The evidence you've cultivated over the last half a year of all the times you've stuck through the hard times and felt foolish or too slow and fought your way through and leaned on your supports and asked questions and were vulnerable and put in the reps and tried and made mistakes and got better and grew and got more confident
- The fact that we didn't graduate you to be nice - you. earned. this!
