# Differentiation: Push Yourself

During Week 5, we have reserved 3 hours of class time for you to investigate a topic that is outside of the current FE curriculum.  The purpose of reserving this time is twofold. First, we understand that there are a lot of topics that students want to learn more about - and we simply donâ€™t have enough time to cover _everything_ - our focus is getting you ramped up on the skills/knowledge that you absolutely need to secure a job as a junior dev. Secondly, being able to differentiate yourself from other Turing grads is an important piece of the job-hunting process.  Employers want to see your curiosity and passion - and this gives you the avenue (and the time) to demonstrate just that.

## Requirements

*Deliverable: Reflection Paper*

This should be 2-3 paragraphs in length. Your reflection should address the following:

  * What topic/technology did you research?
  * What do you already know about this topic? What are you hoping to learn?
  * Summarize what the most important/significant things someone should know about your topic.
  * How can you adapt and apply what you learned from this topic to your future interviews? Your future career as a dev?
  
Other questions you might consider to help guide your reflection are listed below:
  
  * To what extend did your prior technical knowledge (on other seemingly unrelated topics) help you understand the new material?
  * What might be a metaphor or analogy for the topic you researched?
  * What surprised you about what you learned?
  * What were your roadblocks? How did I move through them?

*Resources*
As part of your deliverable, you are required to cite _at least_ four sources that you used as part of your research into this topic. These can be videos, blog posts, documentation, etc. 

*Above and Beyond*

Though not required, you are welcome to submit any of the following in addition to your reflection:

* A blog post (can be published anywhere). Should be 4-5 paragraphs demonstrating your knowledge of the topic that you researched.
* A small, one page to-do list application that incorporates a piece of the technology that you used. 
* An 8 - 10 minute coding/lecture video that walks viewers through the concepts/topic you researched.
* THE SKY IS THE LIMIT! Run your idea by your instructors for approval.


## Due Date
Your deliverables are due to both instructors no later than Monday of Week 6 at 9 AM
