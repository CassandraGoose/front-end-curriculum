      Your mental health is important! We know Turing is stressful. Here are
      several resources that are available to you!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you feel comfortable reaching out to your instructors, we're always
      happy to listen, and we can refer you to other staff members who can
      assist you if you need further help than we can give.

      Students in Colorado can schedule time with Jun, our school counselor,
      on-site depending on his availability, listed
      <a href="https://turing.edu/counseling">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jun lists his availability the week before. Join the slack channel
      #health-wellness for more information from Jun, as well as community
      wellness tips, reminders, and events.
    </p>

      For financial concerns, you can reach out directly to Darren Smith on
      Slack; he can connect you with various services (especially in the
      Colorado area), or help you find services in your area, to help alleviate
      financial stressors.
