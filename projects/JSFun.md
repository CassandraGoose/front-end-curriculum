## Abstract

JSFun(damentals) will focus on practicing three core concepts of the JavaScript language:

* Context
* Scope & Order of Execution
* Prototypes

There are two ways we'd like you to demonstrate mastery of these concepts:

* Accurate implementation/problem-solving
* Eloquent articulation of your thought process


## Work Time

**Fork** this [repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/jsFun) of practice exercises. There are three folders of problems to work through, each corresponding with a concept to be mastered.

Watch this [how-to video](https://vimeo.com/388545928) to get up and running. 

### Practice

Do not worry about completing *all* of the problems. Focus more on being able to thoroughly understand and articulate the solution to the problems you do make it through. For each problem you solve, also add an annotation for how you would walk someone through arriving at that solution. This will help with your articulation piece during evaluations.
