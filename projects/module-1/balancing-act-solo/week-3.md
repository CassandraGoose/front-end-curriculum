title: Balancing Act - Week 3
---

## Week 3

This week's addition to Balancing Act does not introduce any new functionality - we're making sure every little thing works as expected (at least the things we've built), and starting to improve some of our old code.

<section class="call-to-action">
## Check in on Existing Functionality

Make sure every single button behaves the way it should - even if a user has left that "view" then returned to it.

- Close the greeting banner
- Manage Accounts
- New Transaction
- Log Expense
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
## Event Handling

Rewrite the listeners for the nav indicator functionality so that there is only ONE event listener/handler for the nav icons (yep, this means you will need some conditional logic)!
</section>
