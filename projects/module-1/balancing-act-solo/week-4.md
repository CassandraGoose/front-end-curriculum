## Week 4

<section class="call-to-action">
## Responsive Design

Choose one view - Dashboard, Transactions, or Profile - that you'd like to start with.

For your selected view, whiteboard or sketch out in your notebook a responsive layout. All content must still be available for the user but the general layout of the application may be very different for someone viewing on a mobile device. For example, the nav bar on the left side would take up a significant amount of the width of a mobile device, so might be more appropriately placed at the top. In addition, a [hamburger menu](https://uxplanet.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-hamburger-menu-and-its-alternatives-e2da8dc7f1db) might be better than all three icons. _Keep in mind that this is still a web application - don't go down the path of trying to get swipe functionality, etc. that is specific to mobile!_

Once you have a plan for the design, make a plan for your code. You'll want to utilize both
- Liquid Layout (use of relative units)
- Adaptive Layout (media queries)

You may already have a bit of a liquid layout, may need to make some changes. Play around with your app and determine: at what width is the content no longer accessible? at what width does the app no longer keep the spirit of the original comp? Jot down those notes!

Now it's time to write some code. **Update the HTML and CSS necessary to make one (or more!) of your views fully responsive.**

## Refactor Tractor

Refactoring is one of the harder things for folks to do as they are starting out. It can also be hard to justify devoting the time to it when you're always trying to understand the next topic we're learning about in class. Putting the time in now will pay off hugely for you! Also, once you force yourself into it, you'll probably find it to be a pretty fun challengeüòù

- Invite your mentor or rock to be a collaborator on your repository and request a code review. Specifically, you'll want to request feedback on refactor opportunities in your JavaScript.
- Implement at least 2 refactors from that feedback
- Request a second review on the changes made based on the first round of feedback
