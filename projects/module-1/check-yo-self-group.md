title: Check Yo'Self
---

## Specification

Now that you've got the main foundations down to build out a front-end application, it's time to prove to yourself that you own those skills! You're going to be building a checklist application called `Check Yo'Self`!

## Learning Goals

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  * clean & organized CSS styles
  * DRY JavaScript
  * localStorage to persist data
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using `for` loops
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

### Architecture

Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template. You will have three JavaScript files:

1. A `todo-list.js` file that contains a `ToDoList` class.
  * `ToDoList` should have the following properties:
    1. _id_ should be a unique identifier
    2. _title_ is a string
    3. _urgent_ is a boolean value
    4. _tasks_ should be an array of task objects
	* `ToDoList` methods must include, _but are not limited to_:
		1. `constructor`
		2. `saveToStorage`
		3. `deleteFromStorage`
		4. `updateToDo` (should update the todo's title and urgency)
		5. `updateTask` (should update a task's content and if it has been completed)
2. A `task.js` file that contains a `Task` class. We aren't giving you any requirements about what methods or properties should be on it.
3. A `main.js` file that contains all DOM related JavaScript

Each todo list on the page should be created as an instance of the `ToDoList` class.

### Iteration 0: Beginning User Flow

#### Viewing the List of To-Dos

When visiting the application, the user should:

* See a list of all existing to-dos, including the title, list of tasks to be checked off, and state of urgency.
* See to-dos in descending chronological order (with the most recently created to-do at the top left).
  * If there are no to-dos yet, then there should be an indication to the user to create a todo list, displayed in the empty section. You should use your best judgement to create the design for this.

#### Adding a New Checklist

On the left side of the page, a user should see:

* Two inputs for entering the title and adding a new task to the list.
* Two buttons including a `Make Task List` button for committing the checklist and a `Clear All` button to clear the title and checklist.
* Lastly, there should be a `Filter by Urgency` button.

When a user adds a new `Task Item`:

* The task is added to the bottom of the checklist in between the `Task Title` and `Task Item` inputs
* Each task on the checklist should also be able to be removed by clicking the respective "delete" button.
* It should not add a task to the checklist if the input is empty.

When a user clicks `Make Task List`:

* A new card with the provided title and tasks should appear in the todo list.
* The text fields and checklist in the form should be cleared and ready to accept a new todo.
* The `Make Task List` button should be disabled if either the title input or checklist is empty.
* The page _should not_ reload.

When a user clicks `Clear All`:
* Both the title input and list of tasks should be cleared.
* The `Clear All` button should be disabled if both the title input and checklist are empty.

### Iteration 1: Completing The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

#### Checking Off A Task

After a user has completed a task on their checklist, they should be able to check it off.

* There should be a visual cue so that the user knows what they have completed and what is still left to do.
* The update of the data model should occur in the `updateTask` method that is defined in the `ToDoList` class.
* How the DOM gets updated using JavaScript should happen in the `main.js` file.

#### Deleting an Existing ToDo Card

After creating a to-do card, the user should be able to remove it once they have completed their checklist.

* Each to-do card on the to-do list should have a button to remove it from both the data model and the DOM.
* The "Delete" button should only be enabled only if all of the tasks on the checklist have been checked off.
* Upon clicking the "Delete" button, the appropriate to-do list should be removed from the DOM.
* How the DOM gets updated using JavaScript should happen in the `main.js` file

#### Marking a ToDo Card Urgent

A user should be able to mark their to-do cards urgent so that they know which they need to complete first.

* When the user clicks on the `Urgent` button, the button should stay in the active state.
* This update of the data model should occur in the `updateToDo` method that is defined in the `ToDoList` class.
* How the DOM gets updated using JavaScript should happen in the `main.js` file

### Iteration 2: Implementing Local Storage

At _almost_ any point in using this application, the user should be able to refresh the page (or navigate away, then come back) and still have their data.

When a user clicks `Clear All`:
* The todo card should be persisted. It should still be present upon reloading the page.
* The todo should be added to `localStorage` using the `saveToStorage` method defined in the `ToDoList` class.

After a user has completed a task on their checklist, they should be able to check it off.
* Tasks that are checked off should persist upon reloading the page.

After creating a to-do card, the user should be able to remove it once they have completed their checklist.
* The update of the data model should happen in the `deleteFromStorage` method that is defined in the `ToDoList` class.

A user should be able to mark their to-do cards urgent so that they know which they need to complete first.
* Todo cards that are marked as urgent should persist upon reloading the page.

The one feature we **do not** need to implement local storage is:

When a user adds a new `Task Item`:
* Tasks on the checklist of the form _do not need to persist_.

### Iteration 3: Specifying what Content is Viewed

#### Filtering and Searching by Text

We'd like our users to be able to easily find their to-dos, so let's provide them a search bar to filter through their list.

* At the top of the application, include a text field labeled `Search`.
* As a user types in the search box, the list of to-dos on the DOM should filter in real time to only display todo cards whose title include the user's text. The page _should not_ reload.
* Clearing the search box should restore all todo cards on the list.
* There is no need to make persisting changes to the data model to achieve this functionality.

#### Viewing Urgent ToDo Cards

Let's also allow our user be able to view their urgent todo cards only.

* The user should only see the urgent todo cards when they click on the `Filter by Urgency` button. (consequently, the button should be highlighted)
* Clicking on the `Filter by Urgency` button again, the button should no longer be highlighted, and all of the user's to-dos should be displayed.
* When viewing urgent to-dos, the search field should only search through the urgent to-dos.
* If there are no urgent to-dos yet, then there should be an indication displayed in the empty todo section notifying the user to mark some to-dos urgent.
* These changes _do not need to persist_ in between sessions.

### Iteration 4: Improving on the Experience

#### Editing Our Tasks

A user would likely want to edit the title of a todo or update their task later on.

* When a user clicks the title or any of the tasks on the checklist of a todo card, that text should become an editable text field, pre-populated with the existing todo title or task.
* The user should be able to "commit" their changes by pressing "Enter/Return" and by clicking outside of the text field.
* This change should be saved in localStorage using the `updateTodo` method for the title and `updateTask` method for the task defined in the `ToDoList` class.

#### Improving The Search Functionality

Our user might want to be able to search their cards not only by their title, but by their tasks as well.

* The user should have a drop down next to the search bar to select if they want to filter their list by `Title`, `Tasks`, or `All`.
* Searching by the `Title` will be the original functionality where it filters the todo cards by their title based on the user's text.
* Searching by the `Tasks` will filter the todo cards by their tasks based on the user's text.
* Searching by the `All` will filter the todo cards by both their title and tasks based on the user's text.

#### Adding More Tasks To Each Card

The user might also might to add more tasks to their checklist after they have created a todo card.

* Add an input to the bottom of each card so that the user can add more tasks later.
* Each task added should appear at the bottom of the list unchecked.
* The user should not be able to add blank tasks if the input is empty.

## What is a Masonry Layout?

This type of layout is known as a *Masonry layout*.  This layout refers to when items of uneven size are laid out in a way where there are no uneven gaps.  Due to this scenario, this is *NOT* good case for using `grid`.  This is because we can't define where each card is going to be in the layout.  There are a number of solutions to building this type of layout.

* **1:** Application meets all of the expectations of Iteration 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* **4:** Additional elements that have been added match the visuals established in the comps. Every little detail was built out thoughtfully - from hover states to placeholders, etc.
* **3:** Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with **smooth transitions between screen sizes**. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.
* **2:** Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on **desktop and mobile** (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.
* **1:** Application implements all major comp details on desktop only (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Git Workflow & Documentation

* **4:** A PR template was used. A code review was requested and completed by a mentor, and all team members can speak to how the feedback in code review was implemented (and point to the commit(s) that implemented the feedback).
* **3:** Every team member (on a team of 3) authors between 25%-40% of the commits. Most commits are formatted correctly. Every team member contributes to at least 2 meaningful PR conversations. The README is formatted well and contains:
  - Overview of project and goals
  - Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
  - Screenshots of comp and your app
  - Credit all teammates
* **2:** Every team member (on a team of 3) authors between 20%-45% of the commits. More than a few commits are formatted incorrectly. The README is formatted well but may be lacking in detail.
* **1:** Commit and PR history does not tell a story of the application OR a README has not been created/has minimal information.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  **4:** Codebase follows [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [SMACCS](https://smacss.com/), or another set of naming conventions for classes
*  **3:** Codebase does not contain repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
*  **2:** Application has intentional organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules
*  **1:** Crafts CSS according to the [Turing CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JavaScript - Style and Implementation

* **4:**
  * All loops are refactored into the proper array prototype iteration methods
  * Uses logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable
  * When 'Filtering and Searching by Text' and 'Viewing Urgent ToDo Cards', to-dos that do not need to be shown on the DOM should be completely removed from the DOM, instead of only being hidden from view
* **3:**
  * DRY and SRP practices are demonstrated in codebase and students can speak to implementation decisions
  * All functions are less than 10 lines
  * There are no nested if/else statements
  * There are no global variables aside from query selectors and an array for your to-dos
  * Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, checking tasks off, and marking a todo urgent
* **2:** Application correctly implements data model for the `ToDoList` class including all required methods
* **1:** Crafts JS according to the [Turing JS Style Guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
