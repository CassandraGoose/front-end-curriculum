title: Foto Finder
---

## Specification

With some jQuery lessons under your belt, it's time to try your hand at building a small application: a photo album called Foto Finder! For this project, you can use either vanilla JavaScript (`document.querySelector()`) or the jQuery library (`$()`). If you're going to use jQuery, don't forget to pull in the library.

In it's simplest form, the application should have the following:

### Setup: File Structure

Before you start writing code for this project, set up your project directory as follows:

- Your project directory (called `foto-finder`)
- An HTML file called `index.html`, which will contain all of your HTML code.
- A CSS file called `styles.css`, which will contain all of your CSS including media queries.
- A JavaScript file called `scripts.js`, which will contain all of your JavaScript code.
- A directory called `photos` that will contain the image files that the user can save to the photo album page

Here is a visual representation of the file structure:

```
|-- foto-finder
   |-- index.html
   |-- styles.css
   |-- scripts.js
   |-- photos
      |-- photo1.jpg
      |-- photo2.jpg
      |-- photo3.jpg
```

It is up to you to gather images to put into your `photos` directory. These assets are not provided for you - only button assets are provided. In the example above, `photo1.jpq` is just a placeholder name to show you that your image files go inside the `photos` directory. The names of the image files can be whatever you want.

### Phase One

This phase is all about setting up the user inputs and general structure of the page. The page will not be very interactive in this phase.

- Two input fields for new photos to put in the album
  - One for the title of the photo
  - One for the caption of the photo
- One input field to upload the photo (hint: look at the different HTML input element type attributes and how you can use on of them to select a file from your computer)
  - [This article](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/09/15/styling-customizing-file-inputs-smart-way/) can help you with styling the file upload button
- One "Add to Album" button for adding the photo to the album so you see it on the page
- A section for all of the photos in the album to live

### Phase Two

This phase builds on Phase 1 and gives some functionality to the page.

- When a user fills in the Title, Caption, selects an image file from the `photos` directory, and then clicks the "Add to Album", the photo should be added to the photo album.
- Each photo, when added to the album, is placed in a "card", and each photo card should display:
  - The photo
  - The title of the photo
  - The caption of the photo
  - A button to mark the photo as a "Favorite"
  - A button to "Remove" the photo from the album
- The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile
- When the user clicks on the "Favorite" button, the photo card background turns (a different color), and the button should stay in the active (pink) state
- When the user clicks on the "Remove" button, the photo should be removed from the page

Note: If you refresh the page, the photos disappear! This is OK. You do not need to worry about photo persistence on page refresh (we'll handle that in later projects).

### Phase Three

Let's improve the user experience in this phase.

- If the user does not have text in the Title **or** Caption input elements, **or** they have not selected a photo from the `photos` directory, then the "Add to Album" button should be disabled.
- If there are no photos in the album yet, then there should be an indication to the user to add photos, displayed in the empty photo section.
- The file selector should only allow image file types

### Extensions

**Sorting:** If a user marks a photo as a "Favorite", then that photo (an all other photos marked as favorites) should show at the top of the page before any other photos.

**Image Analysis:** Mathematically determine the most prominent color of the photos in the album, and change the background of the album section to that prominent color. The background color should be calculated every time a new photo is added to the album.

**Animations:** When a user removes a photo, the photos in the album shift almost instantly, which is a sharp, hard transition. Add a soft, brief animation that lets the remaining photos move smoothly.

**Zoom View:** When a user clicks on an image card, the application should pop up a large view of the image overlaid on the rest of the album. Once in zoom view, the user should be able to click something on the image (like an "X") to exit out of the zoom view and see all of the images in the album as before.

|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|

|Proficient         | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |
|Exceptional        | Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.|
