title: Hang In There - Pair
---

## Learning Goals

* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Overview

Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? We're going to make our own!

## Set Up

To begin, choose one partner to do the following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

Then, as a team:

* Explore the repository to see what's going on in the code
* What pieces of code might you use to complete iterations, and what pieces will you have to create?
* All of your work will take place in `main.js` - you will not need to change any other files.

## Day 1 Deliverables

By the end of the day, complete the following tasks:

* As a team, read the entire project spec and rubric
* As a team, create a public document for your DTR (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md))
* Add all teammates and your assigned instructor as collaborators to your forked repository
* Create a private Slack channel with all members of the project and your assigned instructor and share links to:
  - the forked GitHub repo
  - the DTR

## Progression

## Iteration 2 - Creating a New Poster

- 
- When the save button is clicked, several things will happen:
  - 

## Iteration 3 - Saving Posters
