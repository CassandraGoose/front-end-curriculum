title: Number Guesser Doubles
---

## Learning Goals

* Develop your skills in writing:
  * semantic HTML
  * clean & organized CSS styles
  * DRY and organized JavaScript
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements

## Overview:

- Build a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability
for the user to add custom ranges for increased difficulty of play
- Display the current guess of both players
- Display the final results of each match in card UI
  - each card should display the name of the winner
  - each card should display both player's names
  - each card should show how many guesses it took to guess the correct number
  - each card should have a **delete** button that removes the card from the page
  - **EXTENSION:** each card should display how long the match took
- Game should be fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px
- Project should be pushed to Github with a live site on Github Pages
- Care and attention to detail should be clearly demonstrated in execution of the comp
- Include a `README.md` in your project that summarizes the project (this does not mean paste this project spec into your README)

## Phase One: Basic Requirements

The application should have the following user interface components:

#### Zero State:
- Two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within
- A button to update the custom range
- for **each player**:
  - An input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values
  - An input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character
- One button that submits both players guesses
- A button for clearing the input field, which *does not* reset the random number
- One button that resets the game and generates a new random number
- The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
- The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.

#### Players Guess State:
- Display both player's most recent guesses
- Display results and feedback for each players guess:
  - If their guess is too high, it should display the error message: "That's too high"
  - If their guess is too low, it should display the error message: "That's too low"
  - If the guess is correct, it should display the success message: "BOOM!" and create a new card to display results _(card details are outlined in Phase Three)_

#### Some things to consider:
- Input fields, regardless of their "type" attribute, store their values in strings. You'll need to use `parseInt()` to turn it back into a number.
- You'll need a strategy for generating random numbers.

## Phase Two: More Better

- Range and guess input fields should only accept numerical entries
- The `Guess` fields should only accept values that fall within the defined min and max range.
- The application should display an error message if the value entered in the `Max Range` input is less than the value in the `Min Range` input
- The application should display an error message if the value entered in the `Min Range` input is greater than the value in the `Max Range` input
- The application should display an error message if either guess is not a number (e.g. `parseInt()` returns `NaN`).
- The application should display an error if either guess is outside of the range of possible answers.
- The application should display an error if the `Update` or `Submit Guess` buttons are clicked when their associated input fields do not have a value entered

## Phase Three: Level Up

Upon successful win, user's range is updated:
- Every time the user wins a round increase the maximum number by 10.
- Every time the user wins a round decrease the minimum number by 10.

Display final result of each match in card UI:
- Both player name 1 and player name 2 should be displayed
- Winning player is indicated
- Total combined guess count of both players is displayed
- Delete button removes the card from page

## Phase Four: Level Up extensions (if you complete all of these, reach out to instructors for more goodies)

Work through these **in order**:
- Display how quickly user guesses correct number
- Include at least 3 different animations. Example: one for when a card gets created/deleted. Check out [this link of great examples for inspiration](https://uxplanet.org/functional-animation-in-ux-design-what-makes-a-good-transition-d6e7b4344e5e)
- Easter Egg: use a [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) to display some secret surprise for users -- have fun, get weird, be creative!!
- Have a **Clear All** button that removes all of the cards from the page.
- Have a sort button that organizes the game cards by the least amount of guesses to the greatest.
- Incorporate in the UI which game has the **High Score**!


## Mid-Way Check-ins

- Have all of Phase 1 completed and start Phase 2
  - Finished UI on desktop views
  - Logic for showing last guess
  - Should append a card when a user wins the game

Being in the place noted above would put you on track for functionality completion. This does not mean that if you don't meet this benchmark, you _can't_ do it; and it also doesn't mean that you are _guaranteed_ to have a passing project if you do have this much functionality. Keep in mind that the rubric weighs the quality of your code much more than your functionality.

## Submission Details

* In your final PR, tag your assigned instructor. Also, make sure that the link to your GitHub Pages site is in the body of that PR.

## Rubric

### Professionalism

- **Exceptional:** Participated in at least one conversation on a PR that was constructive and supportive. *("Great Job" does not count. It should be a conversation where technical considerations/questions arose and moved the project forward or helped all teammates get on the same page about why/what has been/will be implemented).*
- **Proficient:** Pointed to two commits that you made, were able to explain your process, approach, and what the code you wrote does. You made no less than 40% of the commits, and no more than 60% of the commits. You were able to speak to how the event object is utilized for any given event handler.
- **Advanced Beginner:** You were able to explain how any given event listener and it's handler worked. You made no less than 35% of the commits, and no more than 65% of the commits.
- **Novice:** There was a large discrepancy in commits and/or you were not able to articulate what any given event listener and it's handler worked.

**NOTE:** In addition to this rubric, keep in mind that you will complete a survey regarding your partner's professionalism at the end of the project so we have a pulse on how things went. The results will be confidential. We ask:
  - Would you want to work with this teammate agin?
  - Did your teammate honor the commitments made in the DTR?
  - Did your teammate respect your time (show up on time, complete tasks when they said they would, was focused during pairing time, etc)?
  - Did your teammate respect your space & your learning (give you the chance to write some code on your own, give you time to soak in concepts if/when needed, didn't write code without you unless agreed, didn't interrupt you while talking, listened to your ideas and was open to implementing them, etc.)?
