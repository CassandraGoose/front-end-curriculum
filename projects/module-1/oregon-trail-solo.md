## Overview

In front end web development, the programming language you will encounter most
often is JavaScript. Soon, we'll also use HTML and CSS to help a user interact
with our applications, however before we do that, we need to understand how to
use JavaScript to handle the logic of our applications.

In this project, you'll be gaining experience working with variables, primitive
data types, looping, arrays, objects and classes. As you work through the
iterations, be sure to take time to stop and refactor you solutions. There is
rarely one right way to solve a problem in programming, and part of your job
will be evaulating the trade offs between different approaches to solving a
problem.

## Learning goals

  - Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
  - Understand how to declare variables and assign data to them
  - Practice using objects
  - Practice defining and creating classes

## Setup

  - Fork [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/oregon-trail) project to your own Github account
  - clone the repository to your local machine
  - `cd` into the project
  - run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

## Iterations

### 0: Practice Variables, Primitives, Functions, Arrays, and Objects
  - In the `src/` directory, you'll find a file called 'warm-up.js'. Read
    through the instructions in the file carefully. The exercises in this file
    will help you to complete the rest of the iterations  

### 1: Create Gear Class
  - For the rest of the iterations, you will be working to build out some
    classes, using a test suite as your guide.  
  - Start with the Part class.  
    - Unskip the first test in `test/part-test.js`  
    - Run `npm test test/part-test.js`  
    - Read the error messages CAREFULLY!  
    - Make the test pass.
  - Before moving on to the next iteration, take time to refactor your
    solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem? Is there a
    different way you could make the tests pass?  

### 2: Create Part Class
  - Unskip the first test in `test/part-test.js`, and get to work implementing  
  - Run `npm test test/part-test.js`  
  - Before moving on to the next iteration, take time to refactor your
    solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem? Is there a
    different way you could make the tests pass?  

### 3: Create Settler Class
  - Unskip the first test in `test/settler-test.js`, and get to work implementing  
  - Run `npm test test/settler-test.js`  
  - Before moving on to the next iteration, take time to refactor your
    solutions. Is this the best approach to solving the problem? Is there a
    different way you could make the tests pass?  

### 4: Create Wagon Class
  - Unskip the first test in `test/wagon-test.js`, and get to work implementing  
  - Run `npm test test/wagon-test.js`
