# Refactor Tractor - What's Cookin OR Fitlit!

## Goals and Objectives

* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone else's codebase
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process

In this project, you will be building on top of somebody else's pre-existing codebase. It's uncommon that you'll be starting an application from scratch when you get on the job; more frequently, you're entering into a large codebase that other developers have been working on for years. It can be intimidating at first, and may take some time for you to learn your way around. Take this project as an opportunity to get comfortable doing this!

## Getting Started

You and your team will first need to decide which project you'd like to refactor - [Fitlit](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor.html) or [What's Cookin](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor-wc.html).

### How to Choose?
Both Fitlit and What's Cookin' will give you practice with Sass, Fetch, Web Accessibility, refactoring, working with someone else's code and more. Here are some things you could consider when making that choice:

#### Choosing the same as your paired project
- Since you are already familiar with the application and its requirements, you'll spend less time understanding the new spec
- You'll get more experience and exposure to how someone could have solved the same problems differently than you

#### Choosing the new project 
- This will give you valuable practice ramping up on a brand new project
- You might have less temptation to look at your old code

**Note: There are two different versions of each project. You will be assigned the A or B version.**

## Timeline
