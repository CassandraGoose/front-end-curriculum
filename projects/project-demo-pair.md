# Pair Project Demo

Instead of a live demo with an instructor, you'll be putting together short videos to show off your project! 

## Requirements

- You can use any technology for recording your video, but may want to use `QuickTime` since its free. 
- Your video must include: 
  - An introduction from each team member
  - The purpose of the app (why would someone use this app?)
  - A walk through of how to use it
  - Your tech stack (Ex: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mocha, Chai and any NPM packages if used)
  - Wins & challenges 
  - Any future additions 
- Your video should be between 5 and 10 minutes long and uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo when completed 
- **Due Date: videos should be sent to PM's on Wednesday before 3:30 MT for the viewing party**

## Some Inspiration
_NOTE: These videos are from M3 and M4 demo day, your videos will be more minimal._
